Overall, this reduces the time and space complexity required for data mining and allows for easier visualization.\nMethodologies:\n\nfeature selection: find a subset o the original variables.\nfeature extraction: transform the data in the high-dimensional space to a space of fewer dimensions.\n\nA common technique is Principal Component Analysis (PCA). It’s a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components.

For a dataset which is symmetric, it is the center of the distribution. We use a weighted mean when each value has a relevant associated significance, importance, or occurence frequency. The trimmed mean is useful because even a small number of extreme occurences can corrupt the mean. We can remove small portions of the top and bottom of an ordered dataset, but should avoid removing too much as that can lead to unwanted information loss.\nExamples of when the standard form of mean is used is when comparing ages for a dataset or grades on an exam. A prime example for weighted means is calculating grade point average (GPA), where a grade might be a decimal, but is weighted by the number of credits it is worth.\nFor skewed datasets, or if it’s desired to retain outliers, the median is a better measure of the center of the data.\nSince trimmed means and medians are both good to combat the effect of skew and outliers, a decent example for both of these could be when calculating metrics from a dataset containing salaries. Image we have values with a median around $100,000, but there are just a few values upwards of $500,000. This could significantly alter the standard form of average, but if we trim off these high (and/or low) outliers, and then take the trimmed mean we might see it closer to the median.\nThe mode is useful for both qualitative and quantitative attributes, and represents the highest frequency of an attribute. There can be multiple modes, in which case the data is multimodal (unimodal, bimodal, trimodal for 1, 2 and 3 modes). Or, if each value only occurs once, there is no mode! A good visual for representing mode can be a bar chart. Imagine you’re trying to find the day of the week you have the most customers, the day the highest frequency of customers come in, which day has the tallest bar on the bar chart?\nFor a perfectly symmetric curve, the mean, median, and mode are all at the center of the distribution.\nThe midrange is actually another type of mean that can make for a quick statistic in a dataset. However, for asymmetric data, or data with extreme outliers, it’s unreliable."

This also implies \\(sim(i, j) = 1 - d(i, j) = \\frac{m}{p}\\)\nProximity Measures for Binary Attributes: notably the Jaccard coefficient is used for this.

This was likely learned in high school, and it’s still a very common method to measure distances between points.\nFor a single example, these methods can be useful in finding clusters. Suppose a dataset isn’t showing any particular linear pattern. What happens if we set a maximum distance between points to be considered a certain family? Clusters may form."
