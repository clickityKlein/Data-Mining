# Association Rules

We're trying to find *frequent itemsets* given a list of sets. Essentially, finding the subsets within these sets that are commonly together.

Two prime examples of this are items purchased in transactions and movies watched in a library.

## The Basics

### Support

**Support** quantifies how often an itemset appears in a dataset (proportion).

Let $I$ be an itemset, then:

$Support(I) = \frac{\text{number of sets containing } I}{\text{total number of sets}}$

Suppose we have 100 customer's movie watchlists, and we're interested in making association rules surrounding movie $M$.

We know that movie (or movie set) $M$ is in 10 of the watchlists.

$Support(M) = \frac{10}{100}$

### Confidence

**Confidence** quantifies the likelihood an itemset's consequent occurs given its antecent.

Let $C$ be an itemset's consequent and $A$ be an itemset's antecent, then:

$Confidence(C \rightarrow A) = \frac{\text{number of sets containing} C \text{ and } A{\text{number of sets containing} C}$

Suppose we want to recommend a movie (or movie set), $M_2$, and we're creating rules based on those who have watched the movie (or movie set) $M_2$.

$Confidence(M_1 \rightarrow M_2) = \frac{\text{watchlists containing} M_1 \text{ and } M_2 {\text{watchlists containing} M_1}$

### Lift

**Lift** assesses the performance of an association rule by quantifying an improvement or degradation in the initial prediction, where the initial prediction would be the **support** of the antecent.

$Lift(C \rightarrow A) = \frac{Confidence(C \rightarrow A)}{Support(A)}$

*Note that the concept of lift is derived with the help of the concept of conditional probability.*
