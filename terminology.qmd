# Introduction

**Data Mining** is the process of discovering interesting patterns, models, and other kinds of knowledge from massive amounts of data.

**Interestingness** is an either subjective or objective measure to guide the discovery process in data mining in which knowledge from data is judged on being novel, useful, and easily understood by humans.


# Data Mining Pipeline

## Data Preparation

### Cleaning

**Removing noise and inconsistent data.**

### Integration

**Multiple data sources may be combined.**

### Transformations

**Data is transformed and consolidated into forms appropriate for mining.**

### Selection

**Data relevant to the analysis task are retrieved.**

## Data Mining

**Process where intelligent methods are applied to extract patterns or construct models.**

## Pattern/Model Evaluation

**Identify patterns or models representing knowledge based on interestingness measures.**

## Knowledge Presentation

**Using visualization and knowledge representation techniques to present mined knowledge.**
